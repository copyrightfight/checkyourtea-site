Very communicative through messaging and answered questions I had about how the app functions and searched both my names and a couple previous locations. $25 is a steal for the peace of mind it provides, with the amount of ghosting I encounter through dating apps I thought for sure an ex put me on there. Seems like ghosting is just ingrained into the culture at this point, good luck out there my guys",

For all that it's worth, I'm no bot, and I've never met Everythingscoolbro in person. Nor I'd suggest for anyone to trust blindly. However, this man is a MAN OF HIS WORD in a world where words don't mean anything to most people. He's is 100% legit, calm, understanding and above else he got humor. If more men that have his skills would be like him and stand up to these garbage sites and tactics, the world would be just a bit better. He believes on what he does and is a professional at it. If you got any questions about my experience with him, feel free to message me directly, I vouch for him 100%.",
